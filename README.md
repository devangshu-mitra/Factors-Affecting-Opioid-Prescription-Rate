•⁠  ⁠Conducted exploratory data analysis on a large Medicare part D dataset (25 million records), leveraging pre-processing techniques to extract a prescription rate column and grouping it by prescriber state and prescriber specialty, while integrating state policies.

•⁠  ⁠Developed and evaluated three classification models (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost) to predict opioid over-prescribers, with XGBoost delivering the highest accuracy of 89%, while addressing class imbalance issues and applying feature selection techniques.

•⁠  ⁠Leveraged SHAP analysis to interpret the XGBoost model and identify the most significant feature - opioid prescription rate, accounting for almost 50% of the model's performance - by plotting a Beeswarm graph to visualize its impact.

•⁠  ⁠Visualized the state-wise distribution of prescription rates through the use of pie charts and heat maps, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the data and insights for decision-making.

•⁠  ⁠As a Data Analyst, the insights and outcomes derived from this analysis served as a foundation for optimizing the prescription of opioids, leading to improved patient outcomes and cost savings.
